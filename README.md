# Black-Jack
It is one of the most famous casino card game , that pits player versus dealer. It is played with one or more decks of cards. Cards are counted as their respective numbers, face cards as ten, and ace as either eleven or one as long as the value is close to 21. You must then decide if you will "hit" (take another card from the deck), "stay" (keep the hand you are dealt).

If you press hit , another card will be provided to you from the deck and added to you points . If you press stay , the turn is passed on to the dealer. The player who is closest to 21 wins the bet.
